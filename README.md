# ECON-771_Assignment-3

All of the data prep and analysis are conducted in the Stata program 01_RunAnalysis_MW, which draws heavily from Ericson (2014). The file 02_Format Table 1.sas can be run after the Stata code to reproduce Table 1 in a usable format. This code calls the Table1nDone program, which has been slightly customized for this particular table, as it is not normally flexible enough to produce the sums required (maybe someday I'll add that functionality).
